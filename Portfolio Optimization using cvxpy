# ## Optimization with cvxpy
# 
# http://www.cvxpy.org/
# 
# Practice using cvxpy to solve a simple optimization problem. Find the optimal weights on a two-asset portfolio given the variance of Stock A, the variance of Stock B, and the correlation between Stocks A and B. Create a function that takes in these values as arguments and returns the vector of optimal weights, i.e., 
# 
# $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
# x_A & x_B
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# 
# 
# Remember that the constraint in this problem is: $x_A + x_B = 1$
# 
# 

# ## Hints
# 
# ### standard deviation
# standard deviation $\sigma_A = \sqrt(\sigma^2_A)$, where $\sigma^2_A$ is variance of $x_A$
# look at `np.sqrt()`
# 
# ### covariance
# correlation between the stocks is $\rho_{A,B}$
# 
# covariance between the stocks is $\sigma_{A,B} = \sigma_A \times \sigma_B \times \rho_{A,B}$
# 
# ### x vector
# create a vector of 2 x variables $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
# x_A & x_B
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# we can use `cvx.Variable(2)`
# 
# ### covariance matrix
# The covariance matrix $P = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \sigma^2_A & \sigma_{A,B} \\ 
# \sigma_{A,B} & \sigma^2_B 
# \end{bmatrix}$
# 
# We can create a 2 x 2 matrix using a 2-dimensional numpy array
# `np.array([["Cindy", "Liz"],["Eddy", "Brok"]])`
# 
# ### quadratic form
# We can write the portfolio variance $\sigma^2_p = \mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$
# 
# Recall that the $\mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$ is called the quadratic form.
# We can use the cvxpy function `quad_form(x,P)` to get the quadratic form.
# 
# ### objective function
# Next, we want to define the objective function.  In this case, we want to minimize something.  What do we want to minimize in this case?  We want to minimize the portfolio variance, which is defined by our quadratic form $\mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$
# 
# We can find the objective function using cvxpy `objective = cvx.Minimize()`.  Can you guess what to pass into this function?
# 
# 
# ### constraints
# We can also define our constraints in a list.  For example, if you wanted the $\sum_{1}^{n}x = 1$, you could save a variable as `[sum(x)==1]`, where x was created using `cvx.Variable()`.
# 
# ### optimization
# So now that we have our objective function and constraints, we can solve for the values of $\mathbf{x}$.
# cvxpy has the constructor `Problem(objective, constraints)`, which returns a `Problem` object.
# 
# The `Problem` object has a function solve(), which returns the minimum of the solution.  In this case, this is the minimum variance of the portfolio.
# 
# It also updates the vector $\mathbf{x}$.
# 
# We can check out the values of $x_A$ and $x_B$ that gave the minimum portfolio variance by using `x.value`

# ## What's our objective?
# http://www.cvxpy.org/
# 
# Let's see how we can use optimization to meet a more advanced objective.  We want to both minimize the portfolio variance and also want to closely track a market cap weighted index.  In other words, we're trying to minimize the distance between the weights of our portfolio and the weights of the index.
# 
# $Minimize \left [ \sigma^2_p + \lambda \sqrt{\sum_{1}^{m}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2} \right  ]$ where $m$ is the number of stocks in the portfolio, and $\lambda$ is a scaling factor that you can choose.
# 

# ## Hints
# 
# ### x vector
# To create a vector of M variables $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
# x_1 &...& x_M
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# we can use `cvx.Variable(m)`
# 
# ### covariance matrix
# If we have $m$ stock series, the covariance matrix is an $m \times m$ matrix containing the covariance between each pair of stocks.  We can use [numpy.cov](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) to get the covariance.  We give it a 2D array in which each row is a stock series, and each column is an observation at the same period of time.
# 
# The covariance matrix $\mathbf{P} = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \sigma^2_{1,1} & ... & \sigma^2_{1,m} \\ 
# ... & ... & ...\\
# \sigma_{m,1} & ... & \sigma^2_{m,m}  \\
# \end{bmatrix}$

# ### portfolio variance
# We can write the portfolio variance $\sigma^2_p = \mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$
# 
# Recall that the $\mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$ is called the quadratic form.
# We can use the cvxpy function `quad_form(x,P)` to get the quadratic form.
# 
# ### Distance from index weights
# We want portfolio weights that track the index closely.  So we want to minimize the distance between them.
# Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that you can get the distance between two points in an x,y plane by adding the square of the x and y distances and taking the square root.  Extending this to any number of dimensions is called the L2 norm.  So: $\sqrt{\sum_{1}^{n}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2}$  Can also be written as $\left \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{index} \right \|_2$.  There's a cvxpy function called [norm()](https://www.cvxpy.org/api_reference/cvxpy.atoms.other_atoms.html#norm)
# `norm(x, p=2, axis=None)`.  The default is already set to find an L2 norm, so you would pass in one argument, which is the difference between your portfolio weights and the index weights.
# 
# ### objective function
# We want to minimize both the portfolio variance and the distance of the portfolio weights from the index weights.
# We also want to choose a `scale` constant, which is $\lambda$ in the expression. This lets us choose how much priority we give to minimizing the difference from the index, relative to minimizing the variance of the portfolio.  If you choose a higher value for `scale` ($\lambda$), do you think this gives more priority to minimizing the difference, or minimizing the variance?
# 
# We can find the objective function using cvxpy `objective = cvx.Minimize()`.  Can you guess what to pass into this function?
# 
# ### constraints
# We can also define our constraints in a list.  For example, you'd want the weights to sum to one. So $\sum_{1}^{n}x = 1$.  You may also need to go long only, which means no shorting, so no negative weights.  So $x_i >0 $ for all $i$. you could save a variable as `[x >= 0, sum(x) == 1]`, where x was created using `cvx.Variable()`.

# ### optimization
# So now that we have our objective function and constraints, we can solve for the values of $\mathbf{x}$.
# cvxpy has the constructor `Problem(objective, constraints)`, which returns a `Problem` object.
# 
# The `Problem` object has a function solve(), which returns the minimum of the solution.  In this case, this is the minimum variance of the portfolio.
# 
# It also updates the vector $\mathbf{x}$.
# 
# We can check out the values of $x_A$ and $x_B$ that gave the minimum portfolio variance by using `x.value`
